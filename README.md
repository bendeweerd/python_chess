# Python Chess!
This repository contains the code for my Python chess game, my final project for CS 108 at Calvin University.  The game can be played by 2 human players and features move higlighting and a scoreboard.\
\
To use the game, download the zip file, extract it, and run interface.py (you must have Python 3 installed).\
